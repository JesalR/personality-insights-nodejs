He looks dishevelled and tired, but excited and happy.  Enter Freddie having just bought a paper and breakfast items.
2	2	1	Bill? Congratulations! Wonderful news! How is the wee one doing?Edward isn’t it?
3	9	1	Eh. Yes. Edward. Ted.
4	2	1	And whatare they like once they’re...you know...out?
5	9	1	Yeah –no problem. Turns out holding a baby is not that different from a rugby ball. I just popped out to get some supplies.
6	2	1	Yeah  me  too –going  to  cook  up  a  full  English.  Thought  I’d  better make  the  most  of  the  last  leisurely  breakfast  before Lucy and  I  join you guys into parenthood!
7	9	1	When’s she due?
8	2	1	Any day now –this could be the last breakfast!
9	9	1	Do you know the flavour?
10	2	1	A  pink  one!  Just  trying  to  figure  out  what  name  sounds  best  with either Dr at the front.
11	9	1	Or Q.C. at the end?!
12	2	1	Listen  Bill –great  to  see  you –give  my  love  to  Matilda  and  young Edward...sorry... Ted!
13	9	1	Cheers  Freddie –and...all  the  best.  Let  us  know  when  she  arrives. And fatherhood –it’s a breeze!
14	-	2	Matilda and Lucyare sitting with 2 car seats holding Anna and Ted. The new mumsare busy drinking tea and discussing their babies.Projected onto the black curtain is ‘10 days.’
15	10	2	Oh  look  at  them  all  bundled  up  and  sleeping.  It’s  weird  how  when they’re awake you just want them to fall asleep and when they are you want to wake them up.
16	8	2	Lucy –don’t wake them up! I love my son but at the moment, I love him the most when he’s asleep!
17	-	2	Freddie comesbursting into the room looking dishevelled in complete contrast to his smart appearance in Scene 1. He now looks like Bill.
18	2	2	I didn’t know which nappies to get so I got one of each. There’s more in the car...
19	8	2	Congratulations Freddie! So how you finding being a daddy to yourbeautiful baby Anna?
20	2	2	eah –it’s a breeze! Nappies!
21	-	2	Freddie rushes off. Matilda hands Lucy a gift
22	8	2	Ted’s auntie gave him one –she’s a nursery teacher and says these are great for stimulating their little brains.
23	10	2	‘Colourful  rattle  and  patterns  stimulate  vision,  squeals  and  crinkles develop  auditory  senses  and  different  textures  to  grip  and  grab  refine motor skills.’ My word –this thing should get the Nobel Peace Prize!
24	8	2	And she gave me these too. Infant stimulation cards. They will ‘pave the way for your babies’ brain development!’
25	-	2	Freddie enters again with armfuls of nappies and baby stuff –he drops it on the floor and scrambles around. He then moves over towards the babies.
26	10	2	Got anything in there for his brain development?
27	8	2	I think it’s called sleep!
28	10	2	Thank you so much for all these –it’s so kind of you. Ted and Anna are going to be quite the little geniuses with all this around them!
29	-	2	The babies start crying –Freddie turns around nervously. Lucy and Matilda both go to attend to the babies.
30	-	3	Bill is left alone with Ted for the first time in his crib. Ted is crying. Bill is flustered. Projected onto the black curtain is 10 weeks
31	9	3	Now, C’mon Ted. I know you’re not hungry and you can’t possibly need another nappy after what we have just managed to clear up together. The room’s the right temperature and according to your mum’s list I have done everything at the right time and in the right order. So why aren’t you asleep little man? Let’s show mum we can do this –‘dad looking after you for the first time on his own’–thing. “Go out for the evening dear, Ted and I will have a lads night –it’ll be a breeze!
32	-	3	He pulls the mobile cord –lullaby music plays
33	9	3	C’mon Teddy –what do you want to talk about? What’s going on with you?
34	-	3	Picking up blue bear and putting it over the crib –he puts on a silly voice for the bear.
35	9	3	HehTeddy –we have the same name! You can call me bear though. Blue Bear!  I’m really tired –I think I might just go to sleep beside you!
36	-	3	Putting the blue bear downbeside him –crying continues
37	9	3	Nope –ok Ted –we’ll stay up and chat for a bit longer then.
38	-	3	He reaches for the next toy he can lay his hands on
39	9	3	Oh look a pirate ship! Ted look at this. Think of all the adventures we could have on this Teddy –well if you don’t mind your old man coming along that is. It’d be great being on this ship. Once upon a time there was a spectacularly brave and adventurous young pirate called Pirate Ted. He was tall and strong with brown curly hair that was wild and out of control –just like him! He had a scar below his This is a READING COPY of PLAY OF THE WEEK ’CreaTed’ downloaded by Adrienne Ferguson.You can secure the rights to perform this play from www.treepress.org. 9left ear that none of the other pirates know how he got it –although they suspected it had something to do with one-eyed Jo, who had recently stolen Ted’s ship and left him stranded. Ted and his gang of bravepirate adventures were determined to recover their faithful vessel and return to the high seas to protect all oceans and coastlines from the tyrant Jo.
40	-	3	His story is interrupted with a text message bleep that he reads from his wife.
41	9	3	Is Ted asleep? Well I have to say he is! Goodnight Pirate Ted –have great dreams.
42	-	3	He leaves blowing a‘breeze’ into the pirate ship.
43	-	4	Lucy and Matilda are sitting at the table. Ted and Anna are underneath, pretending to hide. Their bare feet are poking out of the side of the table. Projected onto the black curtain is 2 ½ Years.
44	8	4	I just don’t know where Ted and Anna have gone? Do you?
45	10	4	No! Oh dear – we can’t have lost them?
46	8	4	Well we had better look for them. Are they behind the door?
47	10	4	Are they in the fridge? Or in the cooker? Maybe they are munching biscuits in the biscuit tin?
48	8	4	Oh dear – I would be so sad if they were lost forever
49	10	4	Do you think they have been captured by pirates and tied up in a secret dungeon?
50	8	4	Oh no – you could be right – let me get my shoes on so we can go and rescue them – I think I have left hem under....here! (lifts up table cloth to find giggling Ted and Anna) Oh there you are – thank goodness you haven’t been captured by pirates!
51	10	4	Are you both quite safe down there? (replying to Ted and Anna question)Well, that would be lovely thankyou! (taking hold of a pretend cup and saucer and drinking). Hmmm...how delicious.
52	8	4	And for me too-thank you! What a perfect cup of tea! Sorry....cup of pirate tea! And what is in your special brew of pirate tea?
53	10	4	Wow- snail, ladybirds and toothpaste! What a great idea! Yes – I’d love some cake too! Hmmm....how perfectly cooked.
54	8	4	Can I have some cake?
55	2	4	Cake - did someone say there was cake?(Seeing both women crouching on the floor with their heads under the table)What on earth are you doing?
56	-	5	Ted and Ann are playing in their bedroom. They are both hiding in a moving house box. The audience can’t see them! From offstage Bill calls out to them. Projected onto the black curtain is 3 ½ years.
57	9	5	 (offstage)Ted! Anna has to go home now!
58	1	5	(from inside boxes)Oh no – they’re coming to get us!
59	3	5	They won’t find us! Keep digging – we've almost found all the treasure
60	1	5	Good idea! Yes –I’ve found it!
61	-	5	Ted reveals his blue bear teddy from out of the box
62	3	5	Me too!
63	-	5	Anna throws her teddy in the air too triumphantly Parents call them from offstage
64	2	5	Anna darling –come and get your shoes on –it’s time to go home!
65	3	5	Quick quick –let’s get on the boat!
66	-	5	Anna and Ted lift theirheadsout of the box
67	1	5	Yeah –watch out for the sharks though. Bring the treasure!
68	-	5	They both scramble form the boxes onto the bed careful not to touch the ground
69	3	5	Good –now we’re on level 2 adventure. We can keep the treasure safe
70	9	5	Ted!
71	2	5	Anna!
72	1	5	Quick! Let’s get out to sea before they reach us!
73	2	5	I’m going to count to 5 Anna and then I’m coming up to get you!

126	29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,44	6	Hoorah!!
127	23	6	Where are we sailing for captain?
128	21	6	A desert island full of tropical swimming pools?
129	22	6	With mud slides and monkey ropes that can you can swing through the trees and crash in to the surf!
130	29	6	A rainforest full of tigers and unicorns!
131	30	6	And elephants that give you rides .... And can be our pets!
132	31	6	And monkeys that will help build our treehouse village...
133	32	6	Or a mountain covered in fresh snowy powder...
134	33	6	With magic skies that make you faster than a racing car!
135	34	6	And huskies who helpus build igloos and ice fortresses.
136	35	6	An underground empire full of secret tunnels and...dinosaurs
137	36	6	And popstars and marshmallow beds and bubbles!
138	37	6	Or into space in a rocket made from chocolate that takes us to the planet where all toys are invented and everything is freeeeeeeeeee!
139	16	6	Shipmates –we will go to these places one at a time and have the most wonderful adventures in all. We’ll let the ‘randomitor’decide which direction we will head first
140	-	6	She starts to spin around and around and dizzily points in a direction!
141	16	6	...This way!
142	-	6	All pirates head over to peer at what adventures lie in the direction she has pointed, except for JJ who has been spinning uncontrollably and goes in a dizzy stagger to the wrong side
143	23	6	This way –to the land of midnight feasts and sticky fingers, and mud baths and trees to climb and pools to swim, where no-one will tell us when to go to bed and where there will be absolutely no GROWN-UPS!
144	29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,45	6	No grown upssssssssssssss!!! No grown upssssssssssssss!!! No grown upssssssssssssss!!!
145	-	6	JJcan see the enemy approaching –all of the other pirates are chantingand they don’t hear him shout!
146	21	6	GROWN UPS!! GROWN UPS!! GROWN UPS!!
147	-	6	The GUPS clamber onto the shipand JJ manages to scamper across to the other side and get the attention of the pirate adventurers.
148	38	6	We claim this ship you pathetic children!
149	39	6	You are all a complete disgrace!
150	40	6	We are going to bring some order and rules to this dishevelled ship.
151	15	6	Yeah –who’s rules?
152	41	6	Grown up rules! Adult rules!
153	16	6	And who made up these rules?
154	42	6	Why –one-eyed Jo of course –the most grown-up of them all!
155	22	6	So where is Jo then?
156	43	6	Doing what all grown-ups do of course –she’sdrinking coffee!
157	44	6	You wouldn’t want her to come without having a whole cup. Coffee keeps her calm.
158	45	6	She told us to come aboard and see just how much there was to do done
159	23	6	Nothing needs to be done!
160	-	6	A coffee mug emerges over the edge of the ship –Jo has arrived!
161	24	6	Well, that is where you are wrong. But of course you will all be used to being wrong –won’t you, because, you are all children. Young,inexperienced, pointless children. Children are always wrong. You see a child doesn’t know anything...important. They don’t know how things work. They don’t have any clue about anything, or can even make decisions. Hang on -I’m sure you don’t know what thatword even means!!
162	16	6	We know what it means –and we make them all the time!
163	46	6	Yes –but they’re wrong! And that is why you need us, to tell you what to do!
164	15	6	Who says you know best. If you want this ship –you’re going to have to take it from us!
165	24	6	But dear, silly, silly child. Let me explain something to you. We already have.
166	15	6	Well, we’re just going to have to take it back then aren’t we!
167	24	6	Stupidity likethat is exactly the reason why we look down on you so much little Teddy bear. We look down on you, your ship and all your silly little crew. We look down and we feel sorry for you, we laugh at you, we pity you.
168	15	6	You see the problem with grown-ups is that you are so busy looking down that you never take the time to look up and see all the wonderful things that are happening above. You really should try and view the world from a different place –it looks –amazing!
169	-	6	A net falls on top of the adult pirates. They are trapped!
170	16	6	And now it’s time to hear the charges against you! You are charged....
171	29	6	For making us eat vegetables
172	30	6	For making us wash behind our ears.
173	31	6	For stopping our games when we’re not ready
174	32	6	For making us put on our coats!
175	33	6	For making us go to bed in the summer when it’s still light outside!
176	34	6	For sending our friends home!
177	35	6	For making us tidy up!
178	36	6	For making us put on our shoes!
179	37	6	For looking down on us!
180	16	6	And now prepare yourselves Grown Ups to pay the ultimate penalty. All crew-mates have made a decision that you should all walk onto the NAUGHTY STEP!
181	38,39,40,41,42,43	6	No!!!!!!!!!!!
182	-	7	They class walk into the ‘classroom’ behind their teacher Mr Henderson.Projected onto the back wall is 5 Years.
183	11	7	Now well done all of you  -that was some excellent lining up. You lot look like you’ve been at school for much longer than 2 weeks. You’re old pros!
184	4	7	What’s an old pro?
185	11	7	A ‘pro’ is short for professional.
186	7	7	What’s a po-face-in-nail?
187	11	7	A p.r.o.f.e.s.s.i.o.n.a.l. is a person that is very good atsomething and they get paid to do whatever they are brilliant at.
188	5	7	Does that mean that we get paid to come to school then?
189	11	7	Em –no....
190	6	7	Why do we come to school?
191	11	7	Well, you come to school so you can learn.
192	1	7	Did we not learn anything before we came to school?
193	11	7	Well yes –you learnt a huge amount, like, walking, talking, eating, playing, drawing and being friendly –so many other things too.
194	3	7	How did we learn them without being at school?
195	11	7	You just did them without thinking?
196	7	7	How?
197	11	7	Because that is how you’re created?
198	48	7	What’s crea-ted?
199	11	7	It means how you were made?
200	49	7	How were we made?
201	11	7	Well –that is something we can learn at school, but not today
202	50	7	Why?
203	11	7	Because todaywe have to draw some picturesto decorate our lovely classroom and we are going to be writing a story about what we want to be when we grow up!
204	51	7	How old are you when you are a grown up?
205	11	7	Well that depends on the person.
206	52	7	Can you be a grown-down?
207	11	7	Um, no –most people think they are a grown up when they leave school, so, when they’re 16 or 18.
208	53	7	When you have finished how to be taught how to learn?
209	54	7	Grown-ups don’t need any more learning dothey?
210	55	7	I can’t wait to be a grown-up!
211	11	7	What do you want to be?
212	56	7	Do I need to be different?
213	11	7	Imean, what do you want your job to be? What will you draw in your picture?
214	56	7	I’m going to be God.
215	11	7	Wow –but....how are you going to draw that -nobody knows what God looks like?
216	56	7	Well they soon will when they look at my picture!
217	11	7	I hope everyone else knows what they’re going to draw –whatever it is that you want to do with your time when you have left school –I know we have just started school but it’s always good to see what we are aiming towards!
218	-	7	The children start scribbling frantically. They do not hesitate when creating their masterpieces!
219	11	7	Well –that is lovely Ted –you look very colourful.
220	1	7	Well, everything is always very colourful on the ‘DaringDuvet
221	11	7	The what?
222	1	7	The ‘Daring Duvet’ -that’s the name of my ship. And that’s Sonny and JJ and Ellie, and that’s all the rest of the crew keeping watch from One-Eyed Jo.
223	11	7	Oh dear –I hope One-Eyed Jo doesn’t attack the ‘DaringDuvet’ often
224	1	7	Well –she tries to, but we always manage to come up with a plan to make her go away.
225	11	7	What do you think shewants with your ship? Treasure.
226	1	7	Maybe -but most of all she wants to be in charge –she thinks that’s her job, because she’s a grown up.
227	11	7	And is this yourpet that’s standing beside you?
228	1	7	No, that’s Anna  -she’s the captain too and she always comes up with great plans! That is my pet there.
229	11	7	Your parrot?
230	1	7	No  -dragon. And that’s blue bear.
231	11	7	Of course. And how are the rest of you getting on? These pictures are looking tremendous! It looks like we’re all nearly finished. Why don’t you hold them up and tell everyone who you are going to be when you grow up! We already know that Ted is going to be a pirate. Katie?

236	52	7	A lorry driver or Santa.
237	53	7	You can’t be Santa because Santa is Santa
238	52	7	Yeah, but,he might need me to be Santa too one day when he gets old and can’t fly. That happened to my grandpa
239	53	7	A secret spy with a spy kit and special spy gun and spy goggles for spying.
240	54	7	A teacher so I can colour in and draw pictures all day.

256	-	8	Imaginative Ted is alone on the ‘Daring Duvet’. He is playing hide and seek
257	15	8	1..2..3..4..5 –coming ready or not!
258	-	8	Ted starts to search the ship like James Bond. He sees JJ’s foot poking out and approached him
259	15	8	JJ! Found you!
260	21	8	Oh, I always get found first Ted!  I was hiding really small!
261	15	8	JJ –I was just lucky.  –Why don’t you join me on my mission to find the others  -go up to the top of the ship and I’ll search round here
262	21	8	Yes captain!
263	15	8	Now, where are the others? Ah-ha!
264	-	8	Ted uses his sword to poke into another hiding place –it is met by Kit’s sword. Kit emerges dressed as a knight –they have a play fight. Kit eventually trips up
265	15	8	And so –Kit my brave and knightly friend–welcome to my ship!
266	17	8	Thanks Pirate Ted –it’s terrific! Mind if I have a look around. I’ve brought my swimming stuff too so might take a dip

270	15	8	Yes of course –you complete your mission and I’ll complete mine. Now –where will I look –under...here!
271	-	8	Sophie emerges dressed as an astronaut.
272	20	8	I’ve had such a comfortable journey. I was slightly concerned that something may fall out of the overhead lockers on arrival
273	-	8	Sophie finds Fin hiding who is a fireman.
274	18	8	Ne no ne o ne no ne no! Hi –let me just check that there are no potential fire risks on board.
275	20	8	Well, I can tell you that the emergency exits are here and here. Don’t forget that your nearest exit could be behind you.
276	18	8	I’m going to investigate to see if anyone is trapped
277	20	8	In the case of emergency put this life jacket over your head and Inflate pulling the red toggle. If the life jacket fails to inflate blow into this tube.There is a light and a whistle to attract attention
278	18	8	I’m going to check the fire exits. Ne no ne no ne no ne no ne no ne no.
279	20	8	I’m going to check out the on deck entertainment.
280	15	8	Now, all thatis left is to find Anna –she always finds the best hiding places. Is everyone else found?
281	23	8	Everyone except Zandie captain!
282	15	8	I wonder if they’re together. Let’s all split up until they are discovered. We might have to raise to level 2 adventures to find them.
283	17,18,19,20,21	8	Ai Ai Captain!
284	-	8	They all search around ship. Explorer music playing leading into ballet music. Zandie and Anna dance put of the hiding places.
285	15	8	Anna –I’m so glad we found you –now we are all together as we set sail. I didn’t know you could dance Anna?
286	16	8	Yeah I can, but I think it will make me a better pirate to twirl away from Joand the other grown up pirates
287	-	8	She begins to show her dance moves –the otherstry to copy herbut many stumble awkwardly
288	17	8	Grown up pirates? Who is this Jo you speak. Should I fetch my lance –we will joist! En guard!
289	16	8	Jo and the grown upsdo not stand a chance against us.
290	18	8	What makes them so terrible?
291	16	8	So many things. They try and stop us from leading our lives the way we are supposed to. They want to stop all joy, and all and that makes us who we are. They live a life full of rules and order. They don’t ever have any fun!
292	19	8	How did they end up like that?
293	16	8	Nobody really knows. They can’t have been born that way. It’s a mystery.Jo always wants to know all the answers to everything, straight away –but she doesn’t ever take any time to explore to figure things out.
294	20	8	So, what do we do?
295	16	8	We feel sorry for them –and we swearnever to be like them. On this ship we always make sure we exploreand have adventures–that’s the secret. So –it’s my turn to hunt you all pirates and friends. It’s your turn to hide. I’m going to close myeyes and count. Off you go! 5,4,3.....
296	-	9	Ted and all primary classmates all enter and sit on chairs. A school bell goes. Projected on black curtain is 7 years
297	12	9	5,4,3,2,1! Ok Everyone should be sitting down with their pencils and ‘1 Love Words’books for our spelling test.
298	5	9	I don’t know why she calls it the ‘I Love Words’ book –I like saying words –that’s no problem,but I do not love having to write them down.
299	3	9	Have you practised?
300	5	9	With words?
301	6	9	Spelling the words?
302	5	9	I practised.....
303	-	9	Miss Barnard speaks in a dull uncreative tone when doing the spelling test
304	12	9	OK everyone! Sharp pencils. Sitting up straight. Please write down the first word which is IDEA –It’s good to have ideas. IDEA. Next word, CREATE –at school we learn how to create. CREATE. The next two words are related to create and they are CREATIVE  -we are a very creative. CREATIVE. The last word is CREATED –the boy created a good story. CREATED. Everyone got those written down. Now for your bonus word everyone. Listen carefully.The word is IMAGINATION. It is important to use your imagination. IMAGINATION. Now –I wonder if anyone can use it in a sentence?
305	-	9	Ted shoots his hand enthusiastically in the air
306	12	9	Ted –that was quick! Have you thought of a way to use imagination?
307	1	9	Oh yes!
308	12	9	Away you go!
309	1	9	The courageous pirates lined up on the robust and faithful vessel prepared to protect their, treasure, ship and souls as they embarked on a new adventure to discover sights and lands yet unseen!
310	12	9	Well done Ted, -what a sentence –full of big words.... But -you haven’t really used imagination in your sentence have you?
311	1	9	Oh.....um.....sorry. I..um....no.
312	12	9	Well does anyone else have any ideas?
313	4	9	Ideas yes –ideas yes...I do!
314	12	9	Oh good Kit...Let’s hear Kit tell us how to use idea.
315	4	9	The brave and gallant knight found a special magic potion to pour on his lance and shield so that he can slay all fire breathing dragons without any of his weapons melting!
316	12	9	Well –that’s very interesting Kit, but, I didn’t hear you use idea in that sentence. Did you? Perhaps I missed it..
317	4	9	Oh...no... I didn’t. I just said,you know......my idea.
318	12	9	Doesn’t matter –perhaps I wasn’t clear. Let’s have a go with the other 3 words shall we?  Create, Creative or Created...any ideas at how we can use them properly in a sentence?
319	6	9	The class are disheartened and have lost all creativity in their answers
320	6	9	I am creative?
321	12	9	Good! Yes –perfect. Anyone else want to have a go?
322	7	9	Sometimes people create things?
323	12	9	Excellent Sophie! Last one anyone? Created?
324	3	9	We are all created to create creative ideas and use our imagination.
325	12	9	Anna –how wonderful! You have used all 5 words! I’m going to give you a special sticker –very well done. Quite brilliant! Now let’s hand these books in so I can mark them please!
326	1	9	I never get a special sticker.
327	3	9	I thought your story was brilliant –and your idea Kit. Let’s have a level 3 adventure at playtime and we can use the magic potion on the ship.
328	1	9	When’s playtime?
329	4	9	Ages away.....
330	6	9	Yeah –but it says on the board that once we have done spelling –its time for Art –before playtime. I love art!
331	12	9	Now  -let’s pass around the sketch books please everyone.I have a bowl of apples here and what I would like you to do is see if you can draw them from where you are sitting. They will look different depending on the way you look at them. Explore their colours, angles, the way they bend and shine in the light. From where you are sitting they may not even look like apples. Draw what you see everyone. Look carefully.
332	-	9	Everyone starts to look at the apples and sketch. Ted is looking at the apples and as he does this, the pirate adventurers appearbehind him and start to play with the apples. They throw them around the ship, juggling,playing catch, and having a wonderful time. Ted starts to draw applesflyingall over his page excitedly
333	12	9	Ted, Ted –wait  -you’re supposed to be drawing the apples. They’re not flying around Ted –they’re in the bowl.
334	-	9	All pirate adventures freeze holding their apples.
335	12	9	Look. Let’s rub those out and draw what you see in front of you. You really must listen Ted. Now come on start again please. How about I start for you and then you carry on. Now pick up your pencil –have a good look. No –rub that part out.
336	-	9	The pirate adventurers all drop their apples and fall to the ground. The lights darken, the whole class become puppets –moving slowly and sinisterly in unison to music as they draw the perfect apple in the air. Jo appears and stands behind ‘real’ Ted as if controlling him with strings. A bell rings and the bright classroom lights return.
337	12	9	Now -well done everyone. Special stickers for everyone!
338	-	9	The class remain as puppets and flop over as if their strings have been cut.
339	-	10	Jo is on the ship drinking coffee. Ted, Anna, Kit, Laura, Finand Sophieare all standing on the opposite side of the ship.
340	15	10	You haven’t won you know
341	16	10	Yeah –we’re not going to go anywhere
342	24	10	Go anywhere? I wouldn’t dream of you going anywhere. You’re not going to leave but you are going to change. Grow.
343	19	10	What do you mean?
344	24	10	You’ll start to see things....clearer. Less chaotic. Less wild. More ordered. Structured. Mature.
345	17	10	What’s the point of that?
346	24	10	Because then you’ll be able to focus. Make things happen
347	20	10	Things happen just now!
348	24	10	But –its all frivolous, pointless. None of it leads anywhere
349	18	10	You’re wrong about all of it –you’re wrong
350	24	10	We’ll see. And do you know the best part–the beauty of all of this is –I’m not going to have to do anything. Except....wait
351	15	10	You’re wrong
352	24	10	I’m waiting
353	16	10	You’re wrong!!
354	-	11	Kit, Anna, Sophie, Fin, Laura, Ted set up on a camping trip. They have back-packs and gear to spend the night outside.Projected on the black curtain is 11 years.
355	4	11	OK –so I have brought everything we will need. Torches, matches, walkie-talkies, sleeping bag, balaclavas, comics, camera, survival guide, nets and a strainer.
356	6	11	What do you need the strainer for?
357	4	11	For crushing the bugs!
358	6	11	Ahhhhh!
359	4	11	I figure when it gets dark –we could put the torch on and then wait for all the bugs to come and dance around it. Then we pounce on them with the nets and then squeeze them through the strainer.
360	7	11	Why on earth would we do that?
361	4	11	Well –it says here that in order to survive and avoid starvation and dehydration we have to enter ‘nature’s supermarket’. Bugs contain water...and water is the most important ingredient of our body.
362	1	11	Wicked! We could mash the bugs all up and call it ‘Bug-Ade’...
363	6	11	I thought this was supposed to be a birthday party! What happened to sausage rolls and ice-cream. Nobody said anything about drinking bug-ade!!
364	3	11	Don’t worry –I think my and Ted’s mum have got the food sorted
365	7	11	This has definitely been your best joint birthday party yet guys. Camping out all night –brilliant idea.
366	6	11	Have you guys always had joint parties?
367	3	11	Yeah –but I think this is the first one in a tent –and not pirate themed!
368	-	11	Ted emerges from tent with a pirate bandana. The boys have drawn camouflage stripes on their faces
369	3	11	Well –almost not pirate themed!
370	7	11	It is going to be safe though isn’t it –you know –out here all night?
371	3	11	Of course –its only Ted’s back garden. There’s nothing scary here –believe me. I’ve been in every single corner of it –and dug most of it up either burying or searching for treasure. You’re perfectly safe.  Oh –unless Daisy still lives behind the woodshed.
372	7	11	Daisy?
373	3	11	Yeah –Ted’s pet dragon  -we made a den for her and everything. She had magic powers, so she’s probably invisible just now anyway!!
374	4	11	Shhh! Did you hear that?
375	6	11	No –what? I didn’t hear anything. What do you mean?
376	5	11	Yeah –I heard something –over there. Something cracked.
377	6	11	What do you think it is –seriously.
378	4	11	Probably a wild cat, like a puma or a black panther –it says in here that they inhabit the countryside and do all their hunting in early evening, particularly near their favourite drink, which is bug-ade!!
379	3	11	Maybe it’s Daisy waking up and stretching before her night flying.
380	6	11	Oh-my word  -I think I can see something on fire –look –over there –there is definitely something flickering. Ah –it’s getting closer!
381	7	11	I wish it was a pirate party now –at least we’d have swords to fight whatever it is off!
382	1	11	Ok everyone –follow me –crouch down –and stay low. When the creature approaches –we’re going to let it go past us and then we’ll see what we’re dealing with and then scare it away
383	-	11	They crouch down. The parents arrive holding a birthday cake with lit candles. The children roar and the parents drop the cake!
384	1,3,4,5,6,7	11	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
385	2	11	What on earth are you doing! We were trying to bring you a surprise birthday cake!
386	10	11	It’s a pirate cake. Sorry I should have said, it WASa pirate cake. With 11candles that looked like canons!
387	1	11	Sorry –we thought you were a black panther...
388	6	11	Or a dragon?
389	5	11	Or after our bug-ade!!
390	9	11	Bug-ade?
391	1	11	Yes –would you like some
392	-	11	Ted offers the parents an imaginary cup as he did when he was younger. They react completely differently.
393	8	11	Oh Ted don’t be silly. Why don’t you help me clear this cake up.
394	9	11	Oh don’t worry about cleaning. They’re outside. It won’t do any harm
395	3	11	Daisy can eat it up!
396	6	11	The dragon
397	10	11	Oh –how silly and funny. Listen everyone –if you need anything we will be just a few strides away in the house. I hope you all stay warm. Docome into the house if you get chilly or fed up.
398	2	11	Night all.
399	1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10	11	Night
400	-	11	All the kids start to settle down. The lights go off. They head to sleep.
401	-	12	Kit, Laura, Sophie, Fin, Ted, Anna all settle to sleep –all goes dark. After a while Ted gets up –he can’t sleep –he takes his torch and plays with it like a light sabre through the air pretending fight. Annawakes up –she approaches Ted from behind
402	3	12	I hope you’re winning!
403	-	12	Ted turns around and is slightly embarrassed
404	1	12	Always!
405	3	12	Jo, I presume?
406	1	12	Of course!
407	3	12	What has she done this time?
408	1	12	Refused to drink bug-ade and tried to get us to tidy up the ship.
409	3	12	Treacherous crimes indeed –you should tie her up and cast her off on one of the rafts. What were they called again?
410	1	12	They are called ‘the lumpy pillows’. You named them remember?
411	3	12	Oh yeah –‘the lumpypillows’ ....
412	-	12	There is an awkward silence between them –Ted breaks it
413	1	12	Heh–don’t you think those stars there looks like waves-they go up and down. They’d be awesome to go crashing over –don’t you think? And then those ones –they look like a massive shiny sword –be great for fighting. And then there,over there see, those look like a sail. It could catch a huge gust of wind and it would kick out and we’d flyover the waves. Don’t you think? Can you see them? Look....
414	3	12	Yeah, yeah...of course.
415	1	12	More awkward silence between them
416	3	12	So only 1 week left until we leave Primary School? You excited?
417	1	12	For the holidays  -yeah –can’t wait!
418	3	12	Be great to be in Secondary School –I can’t wait! There’s so many clubs I want to join! Do you think you’ll join any?
419	1	12	I don’t know –I haven’t really thought about it
420	3	12	We’ll still be in some of the same classes....so you can still have someone to copy from
421	1	12	Yeah –cool!
422	3	12	You got you’re poem ready for the end of term poetry competition?
423	1	12	Kind of. I think it’s a really stupid idea. Who wants to celebrate leaving school by reciting a poem from an A-Z of poets.
424	3	12	I think it’s so we can express ourselves.
425	1	12	Well,  I can think of way better ways to do that.
426	3	12	I got S. I was going to do Shakespeare but then I thought that would be too obvious  -so I’m going to do Robert Louis Stevenson instead. Hewrote treasure island!!
427	1	12	Cool –is your poem about pirates then –lucky!
428	3	12	No-I thought...well...no...do you want to hearit?
429	1	12	No , I  can wait
430	3	12	What letter did you get?
431	1	12	Y...
432	3	12	I’m just wondering...
433	1	12	Y. I got Y. I had no idea what to do so my mum chose on for me, which apparently is perfect because ‘I’m a bit of a dreamer’apparently. Best part about it is it only has 8 lines.
434	3	12	Can I hear it –please?? I ‘d really like to....
435	1	12	Why?
436	3	12	Coz I would –I really like poetry.
437	1	12	Weirdo –some birthday party!
438	3	12	Fine –I’m a weirdo. Shut up and get on with it.
439	-	12	Ted starts to recite the poem very half-heartedly
440	1	12	Had I the heavens embroidered clothes.....’
441	3	12	Ted, do it properly –pretend you’re delivering a great speech to your crew and you want to inspire them!
442	1	12	It’s not very inspirational....
443	3	12	Fine, then say it to Jo –like you really mean it –like a threat or a warning. Or say it to me..
444	1	12	Had I the heavens embroidered clothes.....’
445	-	12	Imaginary Ted appears. Theysay the poem, ‘The Cloths of Heaven’ by W B Yeats,together from different parts of the stage
446	1,15	12	‘Enwrought with golden and silver lightThe blue and the dim and the dark clothes. Of night and light and the half lightI would spread my the clothes under your feet.But I being poor, have only my dreams. 41I have spread my dreams under your feetTread softly, because you tread on my dreams.
447	-	12	Ted’s are now in darkness. Real Ted still has his torch light on.‘Real’Anna and  ‘Imaginary’Anna appear in light facing the audience.  They recite their poem ‘To Any Reader’ by Robert Louis Stevenson together.
448	3	12	As from the house your mother sees You playing round the garden trees, So you may see, if you will look Through the windows of this book, Another child, far, far away, And in another garden, play. But do not think you can at all, By knocking on the window, call That child to hear you. He intent Is all on his play-business bent. He does not hear, he will not look, Nor yet be lured out of this book. For, long ago, the truth to say, She has grown up and gone away, And it is but a child of air That lingers in the garden there.
449	-	12	Light goes out on both Annas. Real Ted turns his torch off. Black out.
450	-	13	A School bell rings. Class enter –the boys start to play ‘Extreme Basket Wars’ –the girls sit on the desks looking unimpressed.Projected on the black curtain at the back is 13 years.
451	5	13	Charge! Take aim. And Fire!
452	-	13	Fin chucks paper into a bin and scores
453	1	13	SCORE! 5 ALL!
454	4	13	Not for long –gimme the ball! Prepare to go down!
455	47	13	And he twists..... and turns..... and quick dummy... and
456	48	13	SCORE!! In your face! We’re in the lead 6-5!
457	4	13	Boom! One more point away from victoryyyyy!!
458	49	13	Yeah –we’ll see about that  -hand it over!
459	5	13	It’s all a matter of pure and simple, perfect....skill....
460	-	13	Fin goes to score but Kit intercepts the ‘ball
461	4	13	Oh look –he’s weaving through the battlements, behind the enemy line and dodges the on coming sniper attack to return the grenade direct to its target! In it goes –BOOOM! Oh what was that about perfect skill?
462	47	13	I do believe that is a WIN!! Which makes all you lot –LOSERS!
463	50	13	Rematch! C’mon let’s go again –you’re lucks outKit –take the long shot from here –quick!
464	-	13	Kit throws the ‘paper’too hard across the room and is caught by Mr Jackson the English teacher
465	13	13	Why –thank you gentlemen –I’m touched -now -sit down!
466	57	13	This isn’t finished!
467	58	13	Bring it on!
468	13	13	So, where did we get to at the end of last lesson? Ruby?
469	50	13	We were discussing if Hamlet had lost the plot sir!
470	13	13	Lost the plot?
471	51	13	Yeah –at the beginning of the story, you know when he sees his dad who had just died appear as a ghost and has a little chat with him?
472	13	13	And do we think he’d lost the plot?
473	52	13	Yeah –he must be a bit messed up to imagine all that going on!
474	13	13	So –it couldn’t have happened–he just imagined it?
475	53	13	I think it could have happened –I believe in ghosts! BUT  -I still think he’s a bit of a nutter!
476	13	13	A nutter?
477	54	13	I don’t think he’s a nutter sir –I’ve read on....and....I think he’s grieving and is probably a bit of a loner becausehe lives in his head alot, which always removes you from the rest of the world a bit, doesn’t it?
478	13	13	Interesting. What do mean living in his head?
479	55	13	Where you don’treally live in the real world –you let your imagination run wild sir!
480	56	13	Yeah –you know –you escape into your head and then don’t have a grip with what is real.
481	1	13	Isn’t that what an imagination is for?
482	13	13	Interesting point Ted –what do people think?
483	6	13	Well, yeah –that is what an imagination is for –but you’ve got to get the right balance –what’s the point of making stuff up all the time and thinking about stuff if none of it ever comes to anything MR JSo –an imagination is only any good if you can produce something from it?
484	7	13	Well, yeah –that is what an imagination is for –but you’ve got to get the right balance –what’s the point of making stuff up all the time and thinking about stuff if none of it ever comes to anything MR JSo –an imagination is only any good if you can produce something from it?
485	47	13	Sounds like you want to keep those in your head –they soundblooming awful!
486	6	13	Shut up! It’s better than writing down the rules for ‘extreme basket wars’!
487	48	13	Give those back –it’ll be an Olympic sport one day –just watch!
488	13	13	And I hope to see you on the podium one day boys. And that is exactly my point. If you did make ‘extreme basket wars’an Olympic sport or created nice sparkly shoes..
489	7	13	Sweet sparking shoes!
490	13	13	Sorry –then you will have made something. Created something –brought something into the world that wasn’t there before. Imagine if Shakespeare hadn’t ever bothered to write down ‘To be or not to be’or‘there are morethings in heaven and earth Horatio then are ever dreamt of in your philosophy! –just think what the world would be like?
491	49	13	I literally do not have a clue what you just said.
492	47	13	A world without Shakespeare would be amazing!
493	13	13	Ok then –how about Robert Louis Stevenson or J.K Rowling, or Beyoncé, Eminem or Stella McCartney, Mr Cadbury, Matt Damon,  Steve Jobs –where would we be without the product of their imagination? What if they had ignored what was inside of them? What would the world be like? There was a part of them, that was bigger than theirwalking and talking and breathing and eating –telling their story  45 was part of  staying alive and making sense of the world around them. They will have wrestled and directed andchannelled their thoughtsand ideas until they had somethingreal in their hands, that no matter what it was –the world in some way, large or small was changed by what they had done.
494	1	13	Doesn’t channelling something just make it smaller and more narrow
495	13	13	I would argue that all inspired thought, creativity, questions, thoughts, inspirations and imaginings that are ignored and given no focused time or direction –well then, they’re just left to float around in the air and a while, well –they’ll just disappear.
496	13	13	So –lets get some of those thoughts and ideas going somewhere today –heh?Here’s a question. Back to Hamlet. What’s the most quoted or well-known line in the play?
497	3	13	To be or not to be?
498	13	13	Now Hamlet is trying to make a decision. To be. Or not to be.
499	1	13	To be what?
500	13	13	That’s what I want you to think about. If you could be anything –do anything, create anything, dream anything –what would you decide? Would you take the chance? Would you go for it and work hard ...and do it?Or would you let it slip away. Fill in the the gaps. To be....... Or not to be.
501	-	13	All hands go up with ‘idea lights’on their fingertips. All class complete the sentence with whatever they want to bring to life.
502	47	13	To be...
503	48	13	To be...
504	49	13	To be...
505	50	13	To be...
506	51	13	To be...

518	-	13	All is quiet for a few seconds and then the whole class explode with laughter! They freeze. Ted’s light on his finger remains on –the bad pirates lean over the edge above him and draw the light away from him –he is left standing in the shadow.
519	-	14	The lights are very low and sinister on the ‘DaringDuvet’ The GUPs start playing with the ‘ideas’ lights that they have stolen from Ted in the classroom. They start passing the lightbetween them with ‘Imaginary Ted’trying to get his ‘idea’back
520	25	14	Look what I’ve got here –it’s a beauty!
521	27	14	Let’s have a look! It’s a fresh one alright!
522	26	14	Oh –it’s heavy isn’t it?The fresh ones always are mind you.
523	38	14	Pass it here!
524	39	14	Let’s have a go!
525	40	14	Oh –it’s all warm and fuzzy!
526	41	14	I love it when they’re ripe
527	42	14	We can definitely have fun with this one.
528	43	14	Here! Oh it’s a fast one!
529	44	14	It’s full of promise
530	45	14	Full of hope!
531	46	14	Full of imagination!
532	15	14	Give me back my idea!!
533	-	14	All GUPs laugh –they are desperate for a good game of ‘Extreme Ideas War’
534	25	14	We were just saying what a fresh juicy idea it is –perfect for playing with!
535	15	14	Just give it back –you’re going to ruin it!
536	27	14	Oh –we wouldn’t want to do that –why don’t you come over here and get it....
537	-	14	Throwing idea it toJasper
538	27	14	Oops –Sorry!
539	26	14	Oh it is feeling a little but lighter –you know what that means don’t you....
540	15	14	That you’re breaking it –leave it alone!
541	-	14	The Pirate Adventurers arrive.
542	23	14	Yeah give it back....
543	22	14	We’ll get it for you Ted.
544	21	14	The others are coming.
545	15	14	Everyone?
546	16	14	Yes –we’re all here Ted
547	15	14	Game on!
548	-	14	Music plays. GUPs throw the ‘idea’ lights around with the PirateAdventurersunable to intercept. Jo enters triumphantly and catches the idea
549	24	14	Why, thank you. How kind of you. What fun you’ve all had –and how wonderful that I get to keep the prize. Not that it will be of much use for anything now. It’s looking a bit empty now. Still it’s nice to stop these ideas from going anywhere –who knows what could happen. I’m going to go pop it in a pond, or a jar... where I can keep an eye on it...and stop it from getting carried away. I suspect they’ll be more of these coming my way –but that will be another day, another game. All these questions,  49ideas, thoughts, inspirations, imaginings –all just floating and after a while –they’ll just disappear!
550	-	14	Mertal, Moon, Jasper reach above JJ, Ellie and Sonny and steal ‘ideas’ from them as they leave. The rest of the Pirate Adventurers and GUPs leave
551	23	14	Give that back!
552	22	14	Get back here!
553	21	14	Heh –that’s my idea!!
554	-	14	Ted, Anna, Kit, Fin, Sophie, Lauraall remain together
555	17	14	I’m sorry we didn’t get it back for you Ted.
556	18	14	I’m sorry we didn’t get it back for you Ted.
557	19	14	They were tough today –but that doesn’t mean we won’t get them next time.
558	20	14	Yeah –and you will have somore ideas Ted –you won’t even miss that one. I bet you’ve got some spinning around already
559	-	14	Grabs an idea from above Ted’s head.
560	20	14	See –I thought so –it’s really heavy –must be a good one.
561	17	14	Pass it here...
562	-	14	The friends playfully pass it around, doing tricks and laughing
563	18	14	Put it back in there Teddy. I bet it’s brilliant!
564	19	14	I can’t wait to find out what it is!
565	15	14	Thanks. And...thanks for all you did today. I really appreciate it.
566	-	14	Fin, Laura, Kit and Sophie all leave laughing and trying to grab ideas from each other.
567	16	14	So –you’re OK then?
568	15	14	Yeah –I’m glad you were around –I’m glad you came for thefight
569	16	14	You know me, I always love a good battle.
570	15	14	It’s just that you’re notalways....you know...around. I can’t find you all the time. You used to be a lots brighter. All of you did
571	16	14	I’m still here Ted –we are all. We fought for you today didn’t we?
572	15	14	I suppose.
573	16	14	Listen –don’t be afraid of things moving on, or changing colour. All the best captains have to keep updating their ships Ted. It can’t stay the same or it will start to rot away. The ship is still afloat –it just may have to head in a slightly different direction –to new places, new adventures, new battles! But your crew will only follow you if they want to go where you’re leading them. If you’re looking like you’re going to run this ship a ground then they will jump ship Ted. Don’t let that happen. This ship has been anchored for a while now. Everything around here has been explored. Jo knows where to find you and before long this ship will be captured and there will no escape. It’s time to raise the sails Ted
574	15	14	But where to?
575	16	14	t doesn’t matter –the important thing is to get moving. What’s the fun in knowing exactly where you’re going anyway? Where’s your sense of adventure Captain Ted?Feel that –there’s a breeze in the air –great sailing weather. It’s just an idea
576	-	14	She goes to leave and throws him an idea
577	16	14	Just think about it.
578	-	14	Ted is left throwing the idea light slowly from one hand to another
579	-	15	Class all sitting on chairs. Mrs Logan enters. Projected onto the black curtain 17 years.
580	14	15	Ok you lot. Could you all move your desks apart into rows. Quick as you can. I’ll give out the papers as soon as you’re ready. Careful with the chairs –you’ll take someone’seye out.
581	5	15	Please can you take my eye out. Seriously –I reckon that’d be better than taking this exam.
582	6	15	Oh stop being so dramatic!
583	47	15	No –I’m with Fin on this one –I’d prefer to haveall my teeth out without an aesthetic then what’s about to happen
584	50	15	And you’d look better too!
585	51	15	And you wouldn’t be able to talk with no teeth –imagine a world where no-one had to listen to you!
586	48	15	Well  -you’ll have no problem making up evil characters in this creative writing exam.
587	49	15	Yeah –just give them 2 heads and loads of warts –immortalise them in fiction!
588	52	15	Big words Will –you been using word of the day toilet paperagain!
589	56	15	I could do with some of that  -I’ll take anything!I’m so confused with all that we have to do with this.
590	53	15	Thoroughly plan your story.
591	54	15	But don’t take too much time.
592	55	15	Write a punchy beginning that grabs the reader
593	7	15	But don’t give too much away at the start.
594	4	15	Describe your characters in detail.
595	3	15	But don’t let them tell the reader how they’re feeling or how to feel.
596	5	15	Have at least 4 indented paragraphs.
597	6	15	But, if it ever sounds rigid or too much like writing, then immediately rewrite it.
598	47	15	Try and include a sub-plot or flashback
599	50	15	But try to avoid using suddenly and never too many explanation marks.
600	51	15	Include a list to show you know how to use punctuation.
601	48	15	But choose every word carefully. Less is something more.
602	49	15	Ensure to use conversations to show direct speech.
603	52	15	And when you so, be sure to only use the verb ‘said’ as the dialogue belongs to the character and any other verb is the writer butting their nose in.
604	56	15	Be sure to be use all your time, reading over your work and editing.
605	53	15	But takeplenty of time to think and plan carefully. Don’t rush.
606	54	15	Exams are not the be all and end all.
607	55	15	But without qualifications your options can be limited.
608	7	15	Work hard, get your head down.
609	4	15	But don’t forget to take time to explore what is happening around you and express who you are.
610	3	15	Be your own person.
611	3,6,7	15	Work hard.
612	1,4,5	15	Think out the box.
613	1,3,4,5,6,7,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56	15	Get your grades.Have a future.Think for yourself.Be unique.Answer the questions.Ask the questions. Follow your dreams.ChannelLearnThinkSucceedCreate
614	14	15	Great –I can see you’re all ready to get started. Oh –someone’s missing!
615	3	15	It’s Ted.
616	6	15	Is he here today?
617	5	15	I haven’t seen him. Mind you –I hardly ever see him these days.
618	7	15	Yeah –he’s turned into a bit of a loner. He never used to be like that.
619	4	15	Well he’s an idiot if he starts missing exams.
620	6	15	He’s surely not that stupid.
621	3	15	I don’t know about that.
622	-	15	Ted arrives late. Heslouches into the empty chair
623	1	15	Sorry I’m late.
624	14	15	Yes you are. We can discuss it in more detail when the exam is complete. Just now –we have to get going. Now –you all know all the ingredients to write a great piece of creative writing. But the most important tool at your finger tips is your imagination. Stretch it, dive into it, immerse yourself into wonderful ideas. Let your thoughts and imaginings run wild.
625	5	15	Is that all?!
626	14	15	You have to chose one title. Turn over and the time starts now.
627	-	15	They turn the pages over. They start to write with their ideas’ flashing on and off over their pages. Ted is very restless and cannot make any ideas come ‘alight’. He looks distressed, trying desperately to think. As he strugglesto write we see the good pirates captured by the bad pirates in the background.Imaginary Ted and Jo are facing each other. RealTed walks out of the classroom and slams his chair to the ground.
628	-	16	Imaginative Ted is on the ‘DaringDuvet all alone. Jo enters
629	15	16	Why can’t you just leave me alone?
630	24	16	You seem angry Ted. What on earth are you so angry about.
631	15	16	I’m angry with you!
632	24	16	Why’s that then?
633	15	16	Because you’re ruined everything. You always have.
634	24	16	And what exactly have I ruined?
635	15	16	When ever I have ever tried to do anything new, exciting, fun, dangerous –whatever. There you are!
636	24	16	And what new, exciting, fun, dangerous whatever have you been up recently?
637	15	16	Nothing! That’s the point! You’ve captured my ship, my crew  -taken all our supplies. I can’t move anywhere. I can’t do anything. I’m stuck and I don’t know how to get going again.
638	24	16	Now Ted –I’ve never stopped you from going anywhere. The truth is my dear Ted –you have been entirely responsible for that all on your own. Hereyou are Captain of this useless ship that has run aground, nouse to anyone. Half of your crew have abandoned you and the rest of them are flailing around struggling to breath. Where’s your sense of adventure now? You see –I don’t see a courageous young exciting pirate. All I see is an angry boy who wasn’t brave enough to move his ship into new water. I don’t need to capture you Ted –you’ve done it all yourself.  And you’re no use to me anyway. You’re no use to anyone. And as foryour crew
639	-	16	The GUPs let go of the Pirate Adventurers. They all remain still.
640	24	16	They can chose to stay here and starve –or come with me and live a life as real pirates,as they were meant to. I already have some friends of yours on board. Bye Ted.
641	16	16	I told you this would happen Ted. Why didn’t you listen? None of us wanted this for you –but you gave up. You left us no choice.
642	19	16	Please come aboard with us Ted. Jo won’t mind!
643	20	16	It is actually really good on board. It’s sometimes hard work but the views are amazing and there’s so many cool places to visit and see.
644	18	16	It’s not boring like we all used to think. We’ve got loads of freedom –we’re pretty much allowed to do what you want.
645	17	16	We’re setting sail soon, heading towards a channel. Josays it’s the best route to take to reach the really amazing places. He says that if we don’t use the channels you just end up sailing round in circles.
646	16	16	Come with us Ted –we set sail soon. We want you onboard –please
647	-	16	Ted remains with his head down. The others fade away
648	-	17	Mrs Logan is busy at her desk. Ted enters the empty classroom
649	14	17	Thanks for coming to see me Ted. Why don’t you sit down –there are several things I want to talk to you about. Can you think what they might be?
650	-	17	Ted remains quiet.
651	14	17	I thought we could go over your mock exam –although in all honesty –there isn’t ahuge amount to go over is there?
652	-	17	Ted shakes his head without looking at her
653	14	17	The good news here is that we can so something to improve for next time. Did you find it hard to understand what you were being asked to do?
654	-	17	Ted shakes his head
655	14	17	So what happened? Ted?
656	1	17	I just couldn’t think of anything to write. I didn’t have any ideas. I just couldn’t do it.
657	14	17	Well, we need to work out how to get those ideas flowing again. You are far too young and vibrant to have run out of ideas already. What will happen when I am old and retired –I need bright young people to figure out how to get me to the moonfor afternoon tea and back in time for Countdown. Or paint beautiful paintings for me to escape into when I cannot walk. Or sculptwonderfulvisions for me to dream about. Orwritepoems or novels that will remind me of the shortness of breath when falling in love and will be my companions as Iremember the pathways of my life. Or build me buildings, or jets or magic wheelchairs or lotions to get rid of wrinkles. Who’s going to do all of that? What do you want to do when all this is over Ted?
658	1	17	This conversation?
659	14	17	No.What do you want to do when you leave school?
660	1	17	I don’t know!How are you supposed to figure it out?
661	14	17	Well –what are your interests, what makes you sit up and pay attention to the world around you? What moves you so much that you can’t sleep? What are you good at? What makes you happiest? You don’t have to tell me, but in order to make all this count –you have to start to consider it –or all of this is for nothing. Just think about it. And then hopefully we can look at filling in some of the blanks
662	1	17	You said there were several things you wanted to talk about...
663	14	17	So –you were listening! I just wanted to give you this information about your work experience placement. It’ll probably do you good to see what life is like beyond the school gate. Don’t lose it......and don’t be late for my class again.
664	1	17	Sorry –and...thanks
665	-	17	Mrs Logan leaves. Kit and Anna arrive into the classroom.
666	3	17	Are you sure you left it in here?
667	4	17	Yeah –I’m pretty sure. Oh –hi. Sorry –I didn’t think anyone was here. I was just looking for something.
668	1	17	I was just heading off
669	3	17	How are you?
670	1	17	Um –I’m ok
671	3	17	You got your work experience info then –where you off to?
672	1	17	Um... I dunno.
673	-	17	Anna looks at his sheet
674	3	17	Heh –same place as me –guess they used our dates of birth to sort us intogroups. Well –they definitelywouldn’t be in the same group if they took good looks and brains into consideration.
675	1	17	Oi!
676	-	17	He throws his mock exam at herplayfully
677	3	17	What’s this?
678	1	17	It’s my mock exam –I’m going to have to stay and start it again. Have another shot at it.
679	4	17	Found it! We better go –we’ve got rehearsals.
680	1	17	Rehearsals –what for?
681	4	17	Hamlet. C’mon Anna –we better go!
682	-	17	Anna goes to leave –she turns back to look at Ted before exiting. They both smile
683	1	17	Good luck with yourstory Ted –it’ll be a breeze
684	-	18	Ted is sitting onthe ship alone. He gets up and starts to examine parts of the ship. He begins to throw an idea around. He doesn’t notice Sonny, JJ and Ellie sneak up behind him. Sonny goes to grab the idea above Ted’s head.
685	23	18	Got it!
686	15	18	Heh –what are you doing here? I thought you left?
687	21	18	No! Well we did go over and check Jo’s ship out with the others.
688	22	18	It was really cool Ted –you seriously would have loved it. It was nothing like weexpected.
689	23	18	And so –we really wanted you to see it ,sowe decided to come back and tell you all about it
690	21	18	But then, when we started on our way back we couldn’t find you...or the ship...or anything!
691	22	18	Everything was so dark and we couldn’t recognise anything. JJ kept falling over!!
692	21	18	Idid not!
693	23	18	But then we saw your idea flickering on and off –and...here we are!
694	15	18	Did anyone else stay behind?
695	22	18	Are we not good enough for you. I think they’ve all set sail Ted.
696	21	18	So –what are we going to do? Where are we heading? What is theplan? Give me some orders?
697	15	18	Well –I though we could have alook to see if the rafts were working
698	23	18	Great ideas! The lumpypillows!
699	22	18	I love the lumpypillows –they’re so fun!
700	21	18	Where are we going to sail them Captain?
701	15	18	Well –I figured we could maybe try and head in the direction of one of...the channels. I’ve heard thewater can be a bit choppy at times....
702	23	18	...but there are some amazing rapids!
703	22	18	I’m so glad we’re going to go down a channel!!
704	21	18	Great idea Captain!
705	23	18	And the weather is perfect.
706	15	18	Yeah –just the right amount of breeze in the air. C’mon

774	-	19	Kit, Ted, Anna, Sophie, Fin, Lauraenter. The workers talk to them.
775	65	19	So this is the world of...
776	66	19	...work.  So very varied, so full of...
777	67	19	..options.Have a look around. There’s so much to...
778	68	19	...see. All will require you to apply...
779	69	19	...yourself. Bring something of who you...
780	70	19	...are.
781	59	19	Training and skills will need to...
782	60	19	...develop. Time to learn and craft and
783	61	19	...think. But every place will need..
784	59	19	.solutions to problems. The ability to see...
785	60	19	....time. To express yourself in some...
786	61	19	form. To perform at some...
787	59	19	...level that shows the skills and passions inside of ...
788	60	19	..you. To see something that will make the world around you..
789	61	19	...better. If you have the chance -why spend your life doing anything..
790	59	19	...else? So what you need are new, fresh...
791	60	19	..ideas.About where you want to channel this life you have been...
792	61	19	..given. You are all different, but have all got the ability to...
793	59	19	...think. To wonder, to question, to ....
794	60	19	Ponder, to explore, to
795	61	19	...imagine..

797	59		So, we’re going to have to try and make this more efficient? Any ideas on what we can do?

808	-	20	Imaginative Ted and Sonny, Ellie and JJ enter having been on a journey. They have travelled to get to the others on the GUP boat. They stand individually facing the audience. They stand in spotlight as they deliver their verse of “The Road Not Taken’ by Robert Frost.
809	23	20	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveller, long I stoodAnd looked down own as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth.
810	22	20	Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claimBecause it was grassy and wanted wearThough as far that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same
811	21	20	And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another dayYet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back
812	15	20	I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I –I took the one less travelled byAnd that has made all the difference.
813	-	20	The light changes. It is bright, vibrant, exciting and full of promise. It looks very different to the ‘DaringDuvet’ Ted, Sonny, JJ and Ellie make their way to the other ship. Laura, Sophie, Kit and Finare playing with some ideas. Ted, Sonny, JJ and Ellie hide and start to throw someof theirlight ‘ideas’over to them.
814	18	20	Heh –did you see that? Where did that come from?
815	17	20	Wow –look at that!! I’ve never seen one like that before? Where did it come from?
816	20	20	There’s another one –look! Quick –get it!
817	19	20	They’re coming from over there! Who do you think it is? Here –let me see them –they’re so heavy!!
818	18	20	And really strong –I’ve never seen anything like it!
819	-	20	Ted, Sonny, JJ and Ellie start to make their way over and sneak up behind them
820	17	20	Do you think they are safe?
821	20	20	Are you scared?
822	17	20	No! I’m just thinking of you know...protecting the ship if we’re being attacked!
823	19	20	Attacked  -who said attacked?! Where are the others!?
824	-	20	They huddle together. Ted, Ellie, Sonny and JJ jump frombehind them.
825	15	20	Boo!
826	21,22,23	20	The friends scream!
827	17	20	Ted! It’s you!
828	15	20	Yeah –did we scare you?
829	17	20	The others were a bit scared, but, you know –I told them it was nothing to worry about!
830	18	20	It’s so great to see you all!
831	20	20	When did you get here? How did you get here?
832	23	20	We’ve just arrived –this place is amazing!
833	21	20	We came on the rafts!
834	19	20	The lumpy pillows!! I didn’t think they would make the journey.
835	22	20	Well –they were a bit slower in places and a littletricky to steer at times and the route wasn’t exactly straight –but –we got here in the end.
836	15	20	We just took at different way.
837	21	20	I can’t wait to have a look around! This place is huge!
838	18	20	Yeah –there’s loadsfor you to fall over –so watch out
839	-	20	JJ falls over
840	17	20	C’mon lets show you around.
841	-	20	All leave except Ted who is looking quietly around by himself. Anna appears at the bottom of the ship. She stretches and dances a little. Ted blows one of his blue ideas over to her. Anna feels the breeze and catches the idea. She immediately turns around. Ted has hidden but appears at the opposite side giving her a fright.
842	16	20	Ted!
843	-	20	She pauses and stares at him
844	15	20	Hi.
845	-	20	They both pause and doesn’t know what to say.
846	15	20	It’s great to see you. Sorry for scaring you.
847	16	20	I wasn’t scared.That much. How did you get there Ted?
848	15	20	The rafts.
849	16	20	That must have been a rough journey.
850	15	20	Yeah –it was pretty hard work at times. But –you know –nothing wrong with a bit of graft to get where you want to go.But the rapids were epic! We had to cling on for our lives! The lumpypillows are looking a lot more lumpynow that’s for sure
851	16	20	I wasn’t sure when, if...you’d get here. I missed you. I mean, not that much, but, you know, Finand Kit were a bit of a handful at times on my own. I’m really sorr...
852	15	20	You don’t...
853	16	20	No –but I am...
854	15	20	Me too.
855	-	20	Anna picks up one of Ted’s ‘ideas’
856	16	20	So –what’s this all about? You’ve been here for 5 minutes and already you’re showing off as usual with the biggest and brightest ideas. You haven’t even explored this place properly yet! Want to see aboard.
857	15	20	Race you to the top!
858	-	20	All the pirate adventurers arrive
859	18	20	I told you –look!
860	-	20	All pirate adventurers erupt with excitement at seeing Ted, all chatting over each other and excitedly greeting Ted. TheGUPs arrive
861	25	20	We heard that you had landed.
862	27	20	Took you’re time in getting here didn’t you. I suspect you struggled to find it after being stranded for so long.
863	26	20	We’ll seehow long you last. Things are very, different on-boardthis ship.
864	25	20	This is not the‘Daring Duvet‘you know full of puerile, harmless play. You have to work for your ideas over here.
865	27	20	You don’t want to start making mistakes –you’ll do some serious damage.
866	26	20	The landscape is very treacherous –lots more to trip you up!
867	15	20	I can see that –things do look different. Thank goodness. And I have to thank you all, grown-ups, for pushing me to get here. I’ve actually got a lot to thank you for. You’ve taught me and my crew some really great moves throughout our battles. We’re going to show you what we’ve got and see what you think. Game on! Keep up –if you can!
868	-	20	Music plays.Ted and the Pirate Adventures and friends all start to throw their ideas around, leaving the GUPS unable to intercept and left flailing around. Jo appears
869	24	20	So, I see you made it. It must have been a tough journey. Not that I’m that interested. What I really want to know is –what are you going to do nowthat you’rehere? What’s next for you Ted? What’s next?
870	-	21	The workers, parents and teachers all speak from the side of the real world stage. The GUPS and Pirate Adventurers all remain still on the ‘ship’ in the imaginary world.
871	2, 8,9,10,11,12,13,14	21	What’s next? Who do you want to be?
872	7	21	Someone who travels and sees the world and helps people get where they want to go.

883	-	21	Imaginary Ted reappears confidently on the ship
884	1	22	There are many things I don’t know about what isnext. But I do know that whereever the breeze takes me, it’ll be vibrant, bright and full of possibility. Why don’tyou stick around –you never know –you might even like it! Just throw up some ideas and see where they take you!
885	-	22	Ted throws an idea up in the air –one of the Pirate Adventures catches it. A UV light shineson the imaginaryship, revealing bright UV florescent paint all over the ship, and all over the pirate’sfaces and costumes.
